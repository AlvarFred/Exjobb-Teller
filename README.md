A project on using godot game with webspeech for speech input into an interactive reading exrpeince where speech is used as input for a listening companion to partake and augment reading stories outload. 

Integration of speech as input to the system enable reading to bedetected using HTML5 webspeech API but also to trigger the activation of images, animations, ambinet audio, controll visual effects and in other wasy make the reading experience more engaging. 

Design for compesating for the speed whith which the webspeech API can recognize words and phrases are part of the design challengen and how to achiece a user experinece where the user does not preceive that the application is slow and faulty. 

Evaluating the preceived accuracy and preveiced lagg/slow recognition is the key evaluation. This not for the webspeechs recognition but for the entire system that might compensate by using effects and other triggers that trigger on partial regognition or low recognition presentages and by activelly keeping the app living and animating when speech is active but still not perhaps accurate enough to trigger all inetended events. 

Also, the applicaiotn uses established stories so recognition-percentage can be callclualted.
