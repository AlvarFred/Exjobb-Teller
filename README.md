A project on using Mobile First Web, AMP, development wiht a Firebase as backend to facilitate individuals to do positive selftalk to improve thier resiliance and give themselves a boost from speeking outload pre-defined messages. The app uses webspeech to recognize that the desired messages has been spoken outloud and provide a sequence of messages top tell oneself and also show art and images to boost the feeling and use confetti and audiop feedback to underline the positive feeling associated with speaking out, though this also may need to be able to be muted. 


The Web App should be developed for downloading and using sequences of messages registered with a particular user that manages the messages and can also follow statistics. Individual users should have streaks and statistics about when during the day and notifications/reminders for daily messagens. Also, users should be able to form groups of users for supporting oneanother. 

The mobile app should be intended to be a App installed on the phone usine things like Capacitor, but initally we will manage the app development using only the web. A Firebase app will also be added to the project.
